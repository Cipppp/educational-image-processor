# Educational Image Processor

This educational web application demonstrates image processing techniques using the Sobel operator for edge detection. It serves as a learning tool for students studying digital image processing fundamentals.

## Features

- **Image Source Options**:
  - Fetch images from the Dog API
  - Upload local images from your device
  
- **Image Processing**:
  - Apply the Sobel edge detection algorithm
  - Adjust sensitivity threshold
  - Option to show gradient components
  - Option to convert to grayscale first
  
- **Educational Resources**:
  - Detailed explanation of the Sobel operator
  - Visual demonstration of kernels
  - Application of edge detection in various contexts
  
- **User Interface**:
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Interactive controls
  - Real-time processing
  - Result history and saving capabilities
  
## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML**: Structured markup with semantic elements
- **CSS**: Responsive styling with flexbox and grid layouts
- **JavaScript**: Event-driven programming with asynchronous operations

### Image Processing Implementation

The Sobel operator is implemented from scratch as a pure JavaScript algorithm, processing images directly with canvas pixel manipulation. The implementation includes:

1. **Grayscale Conversion** (optional pre-processing step)
2. **Kernel Application** (3x3 convolution matrices)
3. **Gradient Calculation** (magnitude and direction)
4. **Thresholding** (to identify edges)

### UI Components

- Login form with validation
- Responsive navigation with sidebar
- Canvas-based image display
- Interactive controls (sliders, checkboxes, buttons)
- Collapsible information panels
- Toast notifications
- Modal dialogs

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Log in with the demo credentials (Email: demo@example.com, Password: password123)
4. Navigate to the Image Processor section
5. Select an image source and upload or fetch an image
6. Adjust parameters and process the image
7. View, download, or save the results

## Educational Context

This application is designed as a teaching tool that helps students:

- Understand the fundamentals of edge detection algorithms
- Visualize how convolution kernels work in image processing
- Experiment with different parameters to see their effects
- Learn about image representation and pixel manipulation

## Development

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
